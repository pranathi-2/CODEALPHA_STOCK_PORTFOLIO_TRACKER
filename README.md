# CODEALPHA_STOCK_PORTFOLIO_TRACKER
The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a Python-based application that helps users track their stock investments, calculate portfolio performance, and manage their holdings.
This program uses the yfinance library to fetch real-time stock prices and track the performance of a stock portfolio.
Users can add, remove, and view stocks in their portfolio, as well as see portfolio performance metrics such as total value, total return, and portfolio return percentage.
